## 🎯 Key Insights & Objectives  
- Monthly Revenue Trend: July recorded significantly higher revenue compared to the other two months.
- Top Revenue-Generating Vehicle Types: Bike, Auto, and Cab Economy contributed the highest revenue.
- Ride Success & Cancellation: Successful ride rate = 89.93%, Cancellation rate = 10.07%.
- Top Revenue Locations: Kothanur Landing, Vijaynagar Square, HRBR Layout.
- Revenue vs Ride Count Analysis: Banaswadi landing had (20 rides) but generated only ₹9.5k, which is lower than Kothanur Landing (23 rides) and Vijaynagar Square (20 rides).
- Low Revenue Vehicle Types: Bike Lite and parcel had the lowest revenue. Increasing prices for Bike, Auto, and Cab Economy may increase revenue.
